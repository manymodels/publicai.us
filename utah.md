# Utah Libraries for Public AI

## 🌐 A New Role for Libraries in the AI Age

Public libraries have long served as trusted centers for information, learning, and community. Now, they have a chance to become something even more: trusted providers of **public AI**.

The [Utah State Library](https://library.utah.gov/) and the [Utah Office of Artificial Intelligence Policy](https://ai.utah.gov/), in partnership with the Library of Congress, Metagov, Mozilla, and the Internet Archive, are launching a pilot program to bring **community-based AI services** to public libraries across the state of Utah. This is your opportunity to join a national effort to make **AI more accessible and useful for your community.**

## 📚 The Library Pilot Program

We are inviting **3–5 libraries across Utah** to join a groundbreaking pilot program in 2025-2026.

Each pilot site will receive:
- A **dedicated AI workstation** with open-source models and a community-specific knowledge interface
- A **grant** to support dedicated staff time to test and pilot the program
- Hands-on **training and support**
- Access to **AI infrastructure** for organizing and localizing community data
- Opportunities to shape the future of public AI in Utah and across America

Libraries will also participate in storytelling, workshops, and a final presentation to Utah lawmakers and stakeholders.

## 🤝 Why Your Library?

- **You're already trusted.** Libraries are among the most respected institutions in the country.
- **You’re already experimenting.** From book club bots to grant-writing help, libraries are exploring how AI can help.
- **You have the skills.** Librarians are information scientists and community leaders—perfectly positioned to steward AI access.
- **You’re everywhere.** Utah libraries reach every corner of the state. This is public infrastructure at its finest.

## 🚀 Get Involved

We’re looking for libraries across **diverse regions and community types**. Ideal pilot libraries are:
- Excited to innovate and serve as AI hubs
- Eager to support community members in accessing new technologies
- Committed to making technology work for everyone

## 🧠 What Is Public AI?

Public AI is AI as public infrastructure—like public parks, highways, electricity, and yes, libraries. It's **open, accountable, and sustainably maintained**, with access available to all.
