title: AI as Public Infrastructure
---

A two-day workshop to discuss public AI in the US, bringing together federal agencies, universities, national laboratories, and civil society.

- **Location**: Library of Congress
- **Dates**: late July, 2024 (dates to be confirmed)
- **RSVP**: [https://lu.ma/public-ai-loc](https://lu.ma/public-ai-loc)

In this workshop, we will bring together public sector professionals, civil society, and academic researchers to discuss _public AI_, or AI as public infrastructure.

Our objectives: 
- To share and learn from each other about methods of opening or sharing AI resourcesâ€”whether within institutions, across agencies, or with the wider public.
- To build momentum for more publicly accessible forms of AI and AI services across the US public sector.
- To discuss and build on existing public initiatives such as public compute and open data mandates.
- To foster partnerships across the federal government, civil society, and academia.
- To build an AI ecosystem that will serve the public interest and foster more equitable innovation.

We will cover these topics from a range of ethical, social, technical, and economic considerations. Other topics include current national initiatives and approaches such as AuroraGPT; the translation of AI research in public labs into public services; practical questions of governance, auditing, assessment, and access; bias and risk; best-practices in engaging the private sector; legal liability; and similar initiatives planned in individual states and in other countries.

While there are many conferences and workshops on AI, this gathering is specifically tailored for individuals and organizations dedicated to leveraging AI for the public interest. Compared to commercial events designed to help vendors pitch products to public sector professionals, this workshop will focus on sharing information and connecting individuals across agencies and organizations. Our hope is that by bringing together public sector agencies, civil society, and academia, we can begin to foster a wider AI ecosystem based around the public sector and the public interest.

Outcomes of the workshop will include discussion summaries, a framework for action in the US public sector, and the beginnings of a network for public sector AI professionals.

Co-organized by the [Library of Congress](loc.gov) and the [Public AI Network](https://publicai.network).
