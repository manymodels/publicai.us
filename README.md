We are organizing a two-day workshop to discuss public AI in the US, bringing together national laboratories, federal and state agencies, and public universities.

**Goals**: To discuss and work toward the provision of publicly accessible AI services by the US public sector. Topics to include AuroraGPT and other national initiatives, the translation of AI research in public labs into public services, practical questions of auditing, assessment, access; bias and risk; partnerships and maintenance; liability; and similar initiatives planned in individual states and in other countries.

**Location**: Likely the Library of Congress or the offices of the Aspen Institute, otherwise potentially Argonne National Lab (Chicago), Pacific Northwest National Lab (Washington), or Sandia National Lab (New Mexico).

**Attendees**: Government organizations working on public AI, technical and policy experts from academia and national labs, a few representatives from other jurisdictions implementing similar programs.
