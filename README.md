## Building a More Public AI Ecosystem
August 14, 2024

An invitation-only gathering to strengthen and spark new collaborations across the public sector, academia, and civil society to build a public AI ecosystem that benefits the American public.
 
Across the government, many efforts are already underway to put AI to work to positively impact the American public, from the AI Executive Order to the National AI Research Resource Pilot. Building on this momentum, this event brings together leaders to lay a foundation for viable public alternatives and complements to private AI systems.

Together, we will answer three key questions: 
- What do we mean by public AI?
- How do we build public AI?
- Who will build public AI?

This event is co-hosted by the Library of Congress, Aspen Digital, and the Public AI Network. We are grateful to the Rockefeller Foundation and Patrick J. McGovern Foundation for their support of this initiative.
